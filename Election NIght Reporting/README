Summary Election Night Reporting Files as taken from press.azsos.gov during the course of the November general election in Arizona. Citations to ABC 15.

turnout.csv is an aggregation of the turnout section of the summary files. It includes a time stamp of the xml file and ballot statistics by county.

This also includes any outstanding ballot estimates made by county election officials. Note: I had an error in my code for the "ballots_remaining" column so as of 12/15/2022 this column is zeroed out. I will regenerate the file when I have time.
